## Why is there a /lib/node-notifer?
The local version of ```node-notifer``` is needed only for the custom notification icon on mac. By default mac uses the icon of the application that is originally sending the notification, in this case it is the module terminal-notifier running through node.js. Creating a clone of ```node-notifier``` which has a clone of  ```terminal-notifier.app``` with switched out app icons using this script [https://github.com/code-with-sam/customise-terminal-notifier](https://github.com/code-with-sam/customise-terminal-notifier).
